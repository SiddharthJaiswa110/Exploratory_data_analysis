ðŸ“Š Exploratory Data Analysis & Machine Learning Projects (Regression & Classification)

This repository showcases multiple data analytics and machine learning mini-projects covering EDA, regression, and classification techniques applied to real-world datasets. Each project demonstrates core steps like data preprocessing, visualization, model building, and evaluation using Python.

ðŸ§  Projects Included

1. ðŸ“‰ Basic Regression Analysis

Performed EDA and applied Linear Regression to predict continuous variables.

Visualized relationships using scatter plots and correlation heatmaps.

Evaluated model using RÂ² score, MAE, MSE.


2. ðŸŒ² Random Forest Regression (COVID-19 Case Prediction)

Predicted daily COVID-19 case counts using Random Forest Regressor.

Handled missing data, feature scaling, and multicollinearity.

Compared performance with baseline linear models.


3. ðŸš• Uber Cab Demand Analysis

Analyzed trip data to uncover patterns in cab usage (by location, time, and category).

Performed clustering on pickup locations.

Built models to predict trip duration and high-demand zones.


4. ðŸ’³ Credit Card Fraud Detection

Used a Random Forest Classifier to detect fraudulent transactions.

Addressed class imbalance using SMOTE/undersampling.

Evaluated using precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC curve.
